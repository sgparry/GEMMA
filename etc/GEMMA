# under the root folders are subdirectories either given by the 
# site base url (domain and path) or a database. In the case of
# backups these are further qualified by date.

# The root directory of all your apache sites. each site should be a sub-dir:
wwwroot=/srv/www

# The root directory for all the file based data for your moodle sites
# each moodle site should have a sub directory tree below this. The names of
# the directories must match your moodle site path; see above example
# site is http://example.com/moodle1 then 
dataroot=/srv/moodle

# The root directory from which custom assets asre copied into the site
# on upgrade. Can be used to install favorites icons. Sub dirs are site
# domain and path
assetsroot=/srv/moodle-custom-assets
