# live was last upgraded on the 1st April 2015. Test has never been upgraded.

# As can be seen above, each variable below denotes a root folder.
# under the root folders are subdirectories either given by the 
# site base url (domain and path) or a database. In the case of
# backups these are further qualified by date.

# The root directory of all your apache sites. each site should be a sub-dir:
wwwroot=/srv/www

# The root directory for all the file based data for your moodle sites
# each moodle site should have a sub directory tree below this. The names of
# the directories must match your moodle site path; see above example
# site is http://example.com/moodle1 then 
dataroot=/srv/moodle

# The root directory from which custom assets asre copied into the site
# on upgrade. Can be used to install favorites icons. Sub dirs are site
# domain and path
assetsroot=/srv/moodle-custom-assets

# Conventional site sub directory used within Apache for html and php files.
# Usually "htdocs" or "html"
htdocs=html

# Root Location of data files for database
dbfiles=/var/lib/mysql

# Root location of backups of database; subdirs are database names
dbbackuproot=/var/lib/mysql.backups

# flags to pass to Percona xtrabackup

# user apache executes under
